#[Kickstart your code!](http://hackstart.challengepost.com/)

Hackathons are fun. Choosing an OAuth library, icons, PaaS, and front-end framework is not. With HackStart, you don't have to start from scratch. 

Each of these tools is built by hackers for hackers. Our team has used them to bootstrap personal projects, so we know you'll build something amazing.

Fork this repo, edit `index.md`, and send us a pull request to contribute. Happy hacking!
